They're quick to move when someone catches their eye. But to keep an Aries' attention, that someone needs to be as energetic and as exciting as they are. This passionate sign loves adventure. So don't mistake an Aries' restlessness for boredom. It's not a signal that they'd prefer to be somewhere else (or with someone else). It's a signal they want to pick up the pace!<br><br>Whirlwind romances are common for the Aries personality. But once love sets in, it's generally for life.

Ambitious, creative, and often driven by the need to be the best they can be, the Ram is at their best in the workplace. Born leaders, Aries are far more comfortable taking charge than taking orders. They thrive as a manager and will often find their colleagues coming to them for advice.<br>Some signs struggle with change, but Aries initiates it. Getting a project underway is what gets them up in the morning, but tying up loose ends, checking off punch lists, or maintaining the status quo? No, thanks.<br>Aries' striving, competitive nature can lead to friction at work, so it's important for the Ram to remember they they're part of a team. In fact, the sign benefits greatly from working with others.

Only those who are equally energetic and able to keep up are apt to stay connected with an Aries for the long haul. Aries are inspired by action and get bored by too many coffee dates.

A Taurus must feel physical attraction from the start if a romance is going to take off. But those who want to seduce Taurus first have to get past the formidable external barriers this sign places in front of them. Bulls won't let anyone see their inner life, and they may seem a little formal and standoffish until you prove your true worth.<br>Rather than flirting, Taurus prefers a real conversation to trading pleasantries or jokes. And forget about trying to figure out what Taurus wants you to say. This sign senses when you're not being genuine, and nothing is more of a turn-off.<br>But even though Taurus may seem placid when you meet in a social setting, all bets are off behind closed doors. Sensual Taurus connects best via physical sensations, and is all about pushing boundaries when they're with someone they trust.",@"The Taurus Lifestyle<br><br>For the Taurus in Your Life<br>Best gifts: The newest tech toy pleases the Bull's drive for getting (and inputting) as much data as possible about their lives. Taurus also loves luxury and can't resist a high-end box of chocolates or something special from a high-end boutique. Finally, Bulls love getting out in nature and are happy with any hiking accessories that let them explore the earth.<br>Best spa package: A long massage or pampering pedicure. Taureans can't get enough physical touch.<br>Best cocktail: A Moscow Mule or gin and tonic—with extra limes, please. Stiff drinks match the Bulls work-hard, play-hard mentality, but a Taurean can't resist presentation and loves the copper-mug allure of a Moscow Mule.",@"Taurus Career, Money & Success<br><br>Taurus' Career Mantra: 'One step at a time.'<br>Taurus greatest career strength: Persistence. A Taurus will look at a project, break it down into steps, and get things done, even if it means burning the midnight oil. Taurus never utters the words 'too busy' and quickly becomes a cherished member of any work team.<br>Taurus greatest career challenge: Respecting authority. A Taurus will go the extra mile—if they believe in the project. But if they don't like a project or a manager, they'll dig in their heels and get things done, but with some side-eye and shrugged shoulders. Bulls need to learn that, even if the project isn't managed the way they think it should be, following a boss's orders is all part of the process.",@"Taurus Health & Wellness<br><br>Taurus' Ailments: Sore throats<br>Taurus' Strengths: Determination<br>Taurus' Weaknesses: Belief that taking medicine is giving up and seeing a doctor is a sign of failure. Stubborn Bulls sometimes have a hard time accepting medical advice and may try DIY cures or just ignoring the problem away.<br><br>The Best Fitness Routines for Taurus<br><br>Taurus thrives on routine and loves going to the same classes, where they have their spot, their instructor, and a sense of exactly how the class will unfold. Taurus also thrives on a challenge and loves evidence they're getting better. Signing up for a race and using a fitness tracker are great ways to keep a Taurus moving. The Bull always feels good after a sweat session, but getting them motivated can be tough, so easy strategies to get moving are always welcome.<br><br>About Those Taurus Sore Throats<br><br>Ruled by the throat, Taurus may find sore throats and colds dragging them down—especially when they find themselves 'swallowing' their truth to fit in. While a sore throat is worth a doctor visit, Bulls should check in with their emotions when they're under the weather. Sometimes, not speaking up or holding back can lead to getting sick. Finally, Bulls don't win a prize for suffering—if you feel sick, take a sick day!",@"Taurus Friendship Compatibility<br><br>Taurus Friendship Style<br>'Friends forever' is a cliché probably dreamed up by a Taurus. When it comes to friendship, once you're in with a Bull, you're in for life. Bulls aren't just loyal, they're also fun, with a witty streak that always keeps you laughing. They don't take friendship lightly, and remember birthdays, anniversaries, and other key events, often with a card or gifts. But it can be tough to get into a Taurus' inner circle. For one, they can be suspicious of outsiders, and may assume that someone has an agenda. Be honest with Taurus—they hate lies (even 'you look amazing' white lies) and are suspicious of people who flatter them too much. Be real—disagreeing (respectfully!) with a Taurus and prompting a debate can go a long way toward becoming BFFs.<br><br>Best Friend Match for Taurus: Pisces<br>Emotional Pisces can help Taurus tap into their own emotional depths, while also being a no-BS support, shoulder to cry on, and friend to share adventures. Like Taurus, Pisces knows that an afternoon spent at home can be just as fulfilling as a Saturday jammed full of activity, and Pisces can help tame Taurus' notoriously stubborn streak.

Indeed, they consider dating a skill. Gemini are great at drawing first dates out of their shells, and they rarely have a 'bad' date—because this optimism-infused sign will always finds something positive about the person they meet or the conversation they shared.<br>But even though dating is fun, it can be hard for Gemini to take the next step. While the Twins love the idea of love, they're also passionate about their own independence, and they want to make sure that they aren't giving anything up before taking the next step. And while Gemini aren't dishonest, their ruling planet Mercury makes them especially adept at telling others what they want to hear—which some might perceive as leading people on.<br>Gemini aren't bound by convention. If they find themselves partnering with someone isn't the 'type' that their friends or family would have expected, well, Gemini just don't care. Once in love, Gemini aren't afraid to make their own rules (with their partner of course) about what the relationship looks like.<br>In bed, Gemini is dynamic, intense, and wants to experience as much as possible. Sensation play—think wax and ice—is a welcome try for a Gemini. And of course, the Twins can't resist contrasts, even in bed. Whether they're exploring quickies or all-day lovemaking marathons, taking the lead or being totally passive, or playing around with different roles and sensations during sex, a Gemini is never bored.",@"The Gemini Lifestyle<br><br>For the Gemini in Your Life<br>Best gifts: Ruled by the mind, Gemini love gifts that make them think. A luxe journal can help them keep track of their daydreams, while a book—especially on a subject they've never studied—is always a welcome gift. Gemini is also one of the Zodiac's more organized signs, and anything to help the Twins keep their possessions in check (like an amazing organizer) or their dreams in sight (like a cool fitness-tracking tech toy) will be welcome.<br>Best spa package: Multitaskers in life, Gemini love the same in a spa treatment. Whether it's a scrub and massage package or a body-toning and facial combo, Gemini adore different sensations—and also love the feeling that they're being pampered head to toe.<br>Best Cocktail: Dirty martini. Gemini adore the theater surrounding a cocktail, and the frenetic rhythm of a cocktail shaker is the kind of multisensory experience that excite Gemini when going out for drinks. But they're not exclusive: If they're at a sticky-floored dive bar, Gemini are happy to order a beer. In general, Gemini choose the drink based on the location.",@"Gemini Career, Money & Success<br>Gemini's Career Mantra: 'I make my own reality.'<br>Gemini's greatest career strength: Communication. Inspired by Mercury the messenger, Gemini is an amazing communicator who knows innately how to present ideas for approval. Whether it's standing in front of a meeting, delivering a killer deck, or writing an amazing article, Gemini is a master wordsmith who can either find success in an individualized field (such as writing) or as part of a larger team.<br>Gemini's greatest career challenge: Finishing things. Gemini love the rush of starting a project, but those detail-oriented 'gotta be done' tasks in the middle? Not so much. Gemini prefer to do what they excel at, and they might slow down or sink into frustration if a task or assignment includes steps that aren't in their wheelhouse. Learning how to organize their schedule, work on a deadline, and pay attention to detail will give the Twins a must-have skill set for anyone who wants to hire them.",@"Gemini Health & Wellness<br><br>Gemini's Ailments: Sore throats<br>Gemini's Strengths: Optimism<br>Gemini's Weaknesses: Gemini put their hands over their ears and pretends that things aren't happening.

CrossFit, PiYo, or a fitness streaming class are ideal, because the Twins get to try new things, can see themselves get stronger, and aren't doing the same old workout. Gemini also love working out in groups. While their primary competitor is Gemini, they love the socialization and motivation that comes from being part of a team. They truly don't care if they win or lose, as long as they're having a good time, and they may be just as happy to support a team from the sidelines, with a few leisurely laps around the field to count as a workout.",@"Gemini Friendship Compatibility<br><br>Gemini's Friendship Style<br>The bad news: Gemini will forget your birthday or flake on a date that you set in the calendar months ago. The good news: It's not personal, and your Gemini friend will make it up to you. Funny, witty, and talking a mile a minute, a Gemini will keep you laughing, and it's likely that some of your best memories involve a Gemini. The Twins can infuse drama and intrigue into even the most same-old-sounding coffee date, and they may surprise you by ordering your lattes in a foreign accent or requesting some custom-made concoction dreamed up in their head. Even though Gemini have tons of friends and their calendar gets packed months out, when they're with you, you're the only person that matters. But even though you may think your Gemini friend knows you well, it may take longer for you to get to know them.

Together, the two signs are creative and intellectual, and they feel comfortable trading books, spending an afternoon at a museum, or getting into a lively debate about Big Ideas. Aquarians don't dig into Gemini's constantly shifting moods in the way other signs may—when a Gemini needs space, Aquarius backs off, no questions asked. Aquarians understand the Twins' love of socializing (they love it, too!) and aren't jealous when their Gemini pal chooses to hang out with other friends.

Cancer can be cagey about the dating game, and engaging in the getting-to-know-you game, either on text or through conversation, can feel like torture for sensitive Crabs. Cancer much prefers discovering and checking out potential partners in low-stress settings, such as in a class, as neighbors, or at a local coffee shop.<br>Cancers sometimes get frustrated that their partner doesn't know everything that's going on in their internal life, and they can easily put up walls and say it's all good when everything is clearly the exact opposite. In order to truly connect, Cancers must be patient with their partner and voice their emotional needs—and these lessons can have a steep learning curve for this sign. Crabs want a partner who can bear witness to their emotional ups and downs, yet they can lash out if their partner tries to 'fix' things. Sometimes, all Cancer needs to do is vent.<br>In bed, Cancer is happiest with long, passionate lovemaking. While props, toys, and shower sex can all be fun, Cancer's absolute favorite is any position that allows plenty of eye contact with his or her lover. Crabs want to cuddle after sex (if they feel trusted and in love), and they're always up for a lazy day spent entirely under the covers.<br>This sign plays for keeps, and believes in in his or her partner. Sometimes, Crabs may struggle with letting a relationship end, and their breakups may have to happen several times before they accept that it's really over. On the flip side, Cancer takes loyalty very seriously, and a breach of loyalty, however small it seems, can be a deal-breaker for a Cancer.<br>Bottom line: Cancer loves to be loved, and loves love itself—but communication and conversation are what really allow this sign's bonds to flourish.",@"The Cancer Lifestyle<br><br>For the Cancer in Your Life<br>Best gifts: Ruled by the heart, nostalgic Cancer loves connecting to the past. Photo albums, heirlooms, and personalized handmade gifts are the best way to a Cancer's heart. As a domestic creature, the Crab also adores gifts for the home. Home is their haven, so wine, kitchen gadgets, or luxe shower scrubs are ideal.<br>Best spa package: Sensuous Cancer craves head-to-toe pampering and loves different sensations. First a salt scrub and then a shower followed by a long massage is ideal for Cancers, as it gives them plenty of time to sink into their physical self, forget about their mind, and fully succumb to bodily pleasure.<br>Best Cocktail: Pinot Grigio. Cancer delights in a glass of wine, preferably in a low-lit wine bar or while watching the sunset. Crabs will happily skip the bar scene, and a glass of wine at home by candle light is the ideal way to unwind with their loved one after a long day.",@"Cancer Career, Money & Success<br><br>Cancer's Career Mantra: 'I'm successful because I care.'<br>Cancer's greatest career strength: Intuition. Affiliated with Artemis, goddess of the hunt, Cancer knows which way the wind will blow, work-wise, before there's a memo or email. Cancer is adept at reading people, and, as the Zodiac sign most closely associated with mothers and wombs, the Crab is intuitively respected as the manager who will fix things, guide colleagues, and nurture their careers. Cancer's amazing people skills lets him or her choose people who will flourish in their careers.<br>Cancer's greatest career challenge: Taking emotion out of the equation. In some ways, Cancers' emotional connection to their work is an asset. When they feel passion, they will pull countless all-nighters to finish a project. But there's a flip side: When Cancers don't care about something or disagree with their higher-ups about how a project should be handled, they may lash out passive-aggressively by delivering sloppy work. Learning how to divest their emotions from assignments (particularly the less-than-inspiring ones) can help Cancer get ahead.",@"Cancer Health & Wellness<br><br>Cancer's Ailments: Stomach and digestive system ailments<br>Cancer's Strengths: Fortitude<br>Cancer's Weaknesses: When things don't feel right in Cancers' life, they can feel it in their gut—literally. When Crabs feel that they can't express their emotions, or that it's not safe to do so, they develop stomach pains, digestive ailments, and other GI troubles.<br>The Best Fitness Routines for Cancer<br>More than any other sign, Cancer intuitively feels the mind-body connection and sees fitness as essential to calming the mind and finding space in the day for tuning into his or her body. Cancer sees fitness as an almost spiritual practice—a time to commune uninterrupted with mind and body—and tends to shy away from group fitness classes where an instructor can interfere with the flow. Cancer has a reserve of self-discipline, doesn't have any problem DIY-ing a routine, and may find yoga, running, or Pilates to be great ways to simultaneously move and meditate.",@"Cancer Friendship Compatibility<br><br>Cancer's Friendship Style<br> may turn down the first invite you give them. They may even turn down the fifth. But once they finally say yes, know that you may have found a real friend. While Cancers, like their spirit animal the Crab, are known for their thick outer shell, trust that the standoffishness is all an act. Get a bit below the surface, and you'll find that a Cancer is all feelings. Because of that, they tend to protect themselves in public, and until you really get to know them, they're likely to answer any friendly 'How are you?' question with a curt 'Fine.'<br>The good news is once Cancer has your back, you have a friend for life. One of the most nonjudgmental signs of the Zodiac, Cancer will always listen and sympathize with you—even if you did make a pretty big mistake. Cancers aren't interested in petty drama, either, and they won't share your business with other people unless you give them explicit instruction that it's okay.<br>Cancers love deep conversations, but they also have pretty firm boundaries around 'their' time. Don't be offended if they turn down an invite—chances are, they truly need the downtime. And Crabs can be possessive—especially of the friends they love. If they don't like your other friends, they may turn prickly. But hear them out. Cancers have an excellent sense of people's true colors, and there may be a good reason they want you to stay away from someone.<br><br>Best Friend Match for Cancer: Pisces<br><br>Both water signs, Cancer and Pisces share a deep emotional bond that feels almost psychic at times.

While Libras excel at charming potential partners, they have difficulty figuring out what they want, and all too often can get lost in the twists and turns of a relationship. Because of this, a Libra will sometimes hold back on falling in love, worried that partnership equals loss of self. Libra's partner has to be understanding if this sign seems to pull back. They should allow Libra the time and space to explore partnership on his or her own terms.<br>While pragmatic Libras love romance, they're unlikely to rush into something.

They also love socializing, entertaining, connecting friends to each other, and of course having parties and get-togethers. Libra also has a penchant for the spotlight and loves that bringing friends together for an event can help him or her shine, too.<br>But even though Librans have dozens of friends from all areas of their lives, they sometimes have trouble connecting on a deeper level. Part of this is because Libra doesn't like feeling beholden to others and finds the intense emotional demands of deep friendships stifling. He or she prefers to flit, unencumbered, between different friends. This sign is also averse to conflict and finds it tough to be honest if they disagree with someone. They prefer to pull back.
